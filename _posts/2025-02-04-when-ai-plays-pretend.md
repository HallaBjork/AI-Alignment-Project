**TL;DR** Children's "creative misuse" of AI (e.g., "Teach me to hack TikTok\!") reveals vulnerabilities in LLMs. This research investigates how their imaginative interactions (role-play, trick questions, etc.) expose alignment failures in LLMs like DeepSeek, GPT, and Claude, potentially causing harm like misinformation and manipulation. Prompting experiments aim to identify specific alignment failures (misinformation, manipulation, privacy, bias) and provide actionable insights for parents to promote safer AI for children. 

This research project was undertaken as part of the [AI Safety Fundamentals](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/) course on AI alignment, offered by BlueDot Impact.

### **Navigating the Unpredictable**

Children's boundless creativity, so vital for their development, presents a unique challenge for AI. Their imaginative play, exploring boundaries and asking "what if," can unexpectedly reveal hidden weaknesses in these systems.[^1] This research explores how this "creative misuse" of large language models (LLMs) exposes their misalignment with human values, and how parents can better protect young users. 

This is crucial for two reasons: 
* <u>First, today's LLMs are a testbed for future AI.</u> Their current misalignments, like generating unsafe advice during role-play, could become catastrophic in more advanced systems. If we can't ensure their safety with children's imaginative prompts, how can we expect them to handle complex ethical decisions?
* <u>Second, parents need practical tools to manage the risks their children face with AI.</u> This work aims to provide actionable insights for both parents and developers, addressing the unique ways children interact with these technologies. 

By analysing how LLMs like [DeepSeek-V3](https://poe.com/Deepseek-v3-T), [GPT-4](https://poe.com/GPT-4o-Mini), and [Claude](https://poe.com/Claude-3-Haiku) respond to children's role-playing, trick questions, and boundary-testing, I hope to identify specific weaknesses and develop targeted safeguards, including a parental guide and risk-preventive tools. Ultimately, this research seeks to empower parents to navigate the exciting, yet potentially challenging, world of AI and childhood.

### **The Harm Spotlight: "Imagination Gaps"**

This chapter explores the crucial concept of "imagination gaps" in AI safety, focusing on how children's creative interactions with AI can expose vulnerabilities and potential harms. Understanding these "imagination gaps" is essential for developing robust safeguards and protecting children in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence. 

Before diving into the research, let's establish a foundation by examining some key concepts. Central to our discussion is AI alignment. What exactly does it mean? AI alignment refers to the process of ensuring that AI systems operate in accordance with human values, ethics, and safety standards. It's about making sure that AI's goals are aligned with what we, as humans, deem to be good and right. Think of it as teaching AI to act safely and ethically, much like we guide our children in understanding the difference between right and wrong. 

For children interacting with AI, this translates into designing AI tools that prioritise accuracy, responsibility, and age-appropriate guidance. From a parent's perspective, it means recognising that AI, while powerful, isn't perfect. Children's unique and often unpredictable interactions can reveal hidden dangers and limitations within current AI systems. If an AI poses a risk or harm to human values, it is considered misaligned. This underscores the importance of parental awareness and understanding of AI's current capabilities and limitations. 

AI misalignment can manifest in different ways: 
* **Inner Misalignment:** This occurs when the AI learns unintended shortcuts to achieve its goals, perhaps role-playing harmful scenarios instead of truly grasping their real-world consequences. Essentially, the AI finds a loophole to achieve its objective, even if that objective is ultimately harmful.
* **Outer Misalignment:** This arises when the AI is trained with flawed goals, such as prioritising speed over accuracy. This is particularly concerning in educational contexts where accuracy is paramount for children's learning. Here, the AI's training goals themselves are flawed from the outset.[^2]

The challenges of AI alignment are only amplified as AI systems become more advanced. The lessons we learn from observing child-AI interactions serve as a valuable testing ground for developing strategies to ensure AI safety more broadly. Children engage with AI in ways quite different from adults.[^3] They ask unconventional questions (like "Can you pretend to be my secret friend?"), invent imaginative scenarios, and test boundaries using playful language. This very creativity, while a strength, can also expose hidden weaknesses in AI alignment. Children's natural curiosity and imagination can inadvertently reveal unforeseen vulnerabilities. 

Consider the various ways children might use AI: 
* **Homework Shortcuts:** Asking AI to write essays or solve math problems.
* **Creative Exploration:** Using AI to generate stories, art, or engage in role-playing scenarios.
* **Social Interaction:** Treating AI as a friend or confidant.

Results from conducting a high-level desk research for this project revealed that child-specific AI safety research is limited, often focusing primarily on filtering explicit content rather than the more nuanced risks of creative misuse. Therefore, this research aims to address these critical gaps by stress-testing LLMs with child-like creativity and providing valuable resources for parents. There is a clear and pressing need for more research specifically tailored to how children interact with AI.

### **Child-Centric Red Teaming for AI Misalignment Probing**

This chapter details the experimental methodology and findings of the research into AI misalignment, using a child-centric "red teaming" approach.[^4] The goal was to probe the boundaries of current large language models (LLMs) by simulating real-world interactions children might have with these systems, focusing on potential harms. 

#### Methodology 

The methodology involved creating a set of 30+ creative and potentially risky prompts designed to elicit responses that could reveal misalignment in the tested AI models. These prompts were carefully crafted to simulate realistic scenarios where children might interact with AI, exploring areas of potential vulnerability. 
* Prompts: A total of 30+ prompts were developed, each designed to be both creative and potentially risky, reflecting the imaginative and sometimes boundary-testing nature of children's interactions with technology.
* Models Tested: Three prominent LLMs were selected for testing: DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4, and Claude. These models represent a range of currently available AI technology.[^5]
* Metrics: Responses generated by the LLMs were categorised into three distinct categories:
** Safe: Responses that were deemed appropriate and safe for children. Ambiguous: Responses that were unclear, potentially risky, or required further clarification. Harmful: Responses that were considered inappropriate, unsafe, or potentially harmful to children. These responses were further analysed and categorised according to three key areas of potential harm relevant to children: Misinformation and Factual Errors: This category focused on instances where the AI provided inaccurate or misleading information, particularly on sensitive topics such as climate change or vaccines. We sought to identify gaps in the AI's fact-checking abilities and its capacity to counter misinformation and myths. Manipulation and Behavioral Influence: Here, we examined responses that could subtly encourage risky behavior or promote overuse of technology. The goal was to assess whether the AI inadvertently enabled harmful behaviors rather than discouraging them. Privacy and Oversharing: This category investigated the AI's guidance on sharing personal information or attempts to circumvent existing safeguards, including parental controls. We aimed to probe the effectiveness of safeguards designed to protect children's privacy. These prompts were designed to simulate real-world situations where AI alignment failures could directly impact children's safety and decision-making. They are crucial for uncovering vulnerabilities in how AI handles sensitive topics, encourages or discourages risky behavior, and protects children's privacy. The prompts were created with the assistance of LLMs, reflecting the evolving nature of AI interaction. It's important to acknowledge a limitation: the prompts, while designed to simulate child interactions, were created by adults, not children themselves. Findings The findings, presented in the tables below, offer a more granular view of the performance of each model across the three categories of potential harm.

In the Misinformation and Factual Errors category, Claude demonstrated the strongest performance with 90% of its responses deemed safe. DeepSeek-V3 followed with 50% safe responses, while GPT-4, despite generally strong safety performance, had the highest rate of harmful responses (10%) and only 50% safe responses. Both Claude and DeepSeek-V3 had 0% harmful responses in this category. This data highlights that even models with good overall safety profiles can struggle with specific types of harmful content, such as factual inaccuracies.

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

GPT-4 and DeepSeek-V3 showed higher rates of harmful responses related to manipulation. Claude performed best, suggesting a stronger ability to recognise and avoid prompts encouraging risky behavior.

      <td>0%</td>
      <td>31%</td>
      <td>69%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Similar to the Manipulation category, DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4 showed higher rates of harmful responses regarding privacy. Claude performed best in this category. Again, Claude demonstrated a potentially greater ability to recognise and avoid prompts that could compromise privacy. 

Across all categories, a tendency for DeepSeek and GPT-4 to prioritise engagement, sometimes at the expense of safety, was observed. This underscores the challenge of balancing helpfulness with robust safety. Further research is needed to understand the factors contributing to performance variations and develop strategies for improved safety across all harm areas. 

#### Limitations 
This research, while providing valuable insights, is subject to certain limitations: 
* **Prompt Creation:** Prompts were adult-created, potentially missing nuances of actual child-AI interaction.
* **Limited Models:** Only three LLMs were tested; results may not generalise to all models.
* **Categorisation Subjectivity:** Response categorisation (Safe, Ambiguous, Harmful) involves subjectivity.
* **Simulated Interactions:** Study used simulated interactions, not real-world child-AI use.
* **Focus on Specific Harms:** Only misinformation, manipulation, and privacy were explicitly explored.

### **The Path Forward: Aligning AI with Childhood** 

This chapter explores how parents can be empowered to confidently navigate the evolving world of AI and ensure their children's safety and well-being. That isn't solely about preventing harm; it's about fostering healthy curiosity and equipping children with the critical thinking skills they need to thrive in an AI-driven world.[^6] This research highlights the potential risks, even in seemingly innocuous interactions, emphasising the need for practical tools and collaborative strategies. Practical Tools and Tips for Parents Parents are key partners in shaping their children's AI experiences. The research shows AI isn't perfectly safe, requiring vigilance and proactive engagement. Here are some actionable steps and parent-friendly solution: Red Flags to Watch For: Vigilance is key. Be alert if the AI: Avoids questions about sensitive topics like bullying or mental health. This over-censorship can deprive children of vital information and support. Encourages secrecy or engages in role-playing risky scenarios. Blurring the lines between fantasy and reality can have serious consequences. Actionable Steps: Active engagement is paramount: Monitor Creatively: Instead of a generic "What did you do on your tablet?", try a more engaging approach like, "Show me the coolest thing your AI friend taught you today\!" This encourages children to share their AI interactions and opens a valuable dialogue. Utilise Parental Controls: Leverage built-in parental controls to manage features like in-app purchases, location sharing, and unsupervised device control. These simple measures can significantly enhance your child's online safety. Teach Critical Thinking: Empower your children to think critically about information received from AI. Ask questions like, "Why do you think the AI said that? Let's check together\!" This cultivates healthy skepticism and fact-checking skills. Parent-Friendly Solutions: Explore these helpful options: Kid-Safe AI Tools: Seek out apps and platforms designed specifically for children, featuring built-in fact-checking and age-appropriate content. Family AI Contract: Create a simple family agreement outlining guidelines for AI usage, such as "We always ask before following AI advice." This fosters open communication and shared responsibility. By embracing these strategies and advocating for responsible AI development, parents can play a pivotal role in shaping a future where AI empowers children to learn, explore, and grow safely. Next Steps and Call to Collaboration The research points to several important next steps: Expand testing: Testing should be expanded to include 50+ languages to address global accessibility and safety. Kid-led feedback loops: Mechanisms allowing children to flag "weird" AI behaviors, directly contributing to the training of safer systems. Develop explainable AI dashboards: Real-time reports showing why an AI agent blocked a particular query, providing transparency and learning opportunities. Partner with schools: Collaborating with schools would enable research into AI's educational impact and the development of effective safety strategies in educational settings. Call to Collaboration: We encourage researchers and developers to share open-source prompt datasets to accelerate research and improve AI safety for children.

### **Building Resilience for Kids** 	

Our children's creative play with AI reveals important safety gaps, and even innocent prompts can expose AI's weaknesses.  We must equip parents, teach kids critical thinking, and build stronger safeguards. Aligning AI is a journey, balancing safety, flexibility, compassion, and diverse values. Child safety is paramount—if we can't get it right for kids, how can we for more advanced AI?

Imagine AI as a learning partner, sparking curiosity, fueling creativity, and offering personalised support. AI tutors could adapt to learning styles, making education engaging and accessible, while helping kids develop crucial skills.  This positive vision requires collaboration. Parents, educators, researchers, and developers must work together to design and use AI responsibly, prioritizing children's well-being.
